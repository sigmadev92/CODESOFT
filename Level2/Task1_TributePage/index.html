           <p>
            Acharya Ji likes to talk in Hindi not because he doesn't know English instead he values the word "Rashtra Bhasha". At one end we are saying Hindi is our "Rashtra Bhasha" and at another end we are not confident in talking in Hindi then why we are saying it "Rashtra Bhasha". He is a philosophical person who talks logically with proper evidences and examples.

           <p>Acharya Ji has got both offline and online presence. He has approx 4.5 M followers on Instagram and approx 52 M Youtube subscribers. It feels so secured when so many people are following a spiritual leader like him. The author of this page, me, ofcourse, listens to him whenever I am free from work. But he himself says that only listennig or seeing him won't help, we have to follow the ideas too which are beneficial for the society. Some of the current and burning issues that he talked on and shared his opinion are listed below. The reader must give attention to these topics. I have provided links to his youtube videos so you can go and listen to him. </p>
